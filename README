CS 4760 Assignment #1

 
Usage

Within the project directory use make to compile the source files.

make

The program will create an executable file called "syscall". To execute the executable, refer to the example below.


./syscall  -h   #Will display all possible options and their descriptions


If the arguments are missing or partially missing. The program will automatically use the default input file name "input.dat" and output file name "output.dat".

Clean

The makefile also includes a clean function which removes the executable, object files, and only the default "output.dat" file if it exists.


make clean
