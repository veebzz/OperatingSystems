CS 4760 Assignment #1

 
Usage

Within the project directory use make to compile the source files.

make

The program will create an executable file called "syscall". To execute the executable, refer to the example below.


./syscall  -h   #Will display all possible options and their descriptions


If the arguments are missing or partially missing. The program will automatically use the default input file name "input.dat" and output file name "output.dat".

Clean

The makefile also includes a clean function which removes the executable, object files, and only the default "output.dat" file if it exists.


make clean


Version Log

Github was used as version control for this assignment. The link to this assignments version control is [Github](https://github.com/veebzz/OperatingSystems/commits/master).

Existing Problems

-The command line executable does not accept multiple option arguments such as:

./syscall -io <argument> <argument>

or

./syscall -oi <argument> <argument>

-If the first line of the child process provides a number higher than the integers provides on the second line, the program will fill the missing numbers with 0.

-If 0 is given in the first line of a child process, it does not write its pid and numbers to output. only the pid is displayed by parent.

-If first line of input data states more number of forks than provided, the program will end at the last valid set of child process data.

-If more than 1 number is provided on the first line or the first line of every child process, the program will only take the first number on that line
