CS 4760 Assignment #6


--Usage--

Within the project directory use make to compile the source files.

make

The program will create an executable files called "oss" and "user" . To execute the executable, refer to the example below.


./oss  -h   #Will display all possible options and their descriptions

./oss  -n <Argument> #Optional argument can be given to set the max concurrent process limit between 0 - 18.

Program for now can just be called without any arguments, which will default to 18 max active processes, and default output file
called log.txt.

--Clean--

The makefile also includes a clean function which removes the executable, object files, and the log file ("log.txt").


make clean
