CS 4760 Assignment #3


--Usage--

Within the project directory use make to compile the source files.

make

The program will create an executable files called "master" and "palin" . To execute the executable, refer to the example below.


./master  -h   #Will display all possible options and their descriptions


If the arguments are missing or partially missing. The program will automatically use the default input file name "input.txt".
The command above will provide more defaults on the other executable options.

--Clean--

The makefile also includes a clean function which removes the executable, object files, and the 2 output files[palin.out, nopalin.out].


make clean

--Existing Problems--

-The program for whatever reason will no print out the first few number of pid into the output files.(Might just be a problem on local IDE(jetbrains))
-Im not sure if i understood the P3 assignment, regarding the for loop. If the P3 assignment asked for each string to be printed
    5 times to see if the semaphore is working, then that is what I did.
-Not sure how the shared memory is keeping multiple spaces or newline characters, I gave up and put a constant to asssess if its a palindrome.
-While testing and messing with project if the program did not asses if palindrome, it would output to a file marked ?.
