--Usage--

Within the project directory use make to compile the source files.

make

The program will create an executable files called "oss" and "user" . To execute the executable, refer to the example below.


./oss  -h   #Will display all possible options and their descriptions


If the arguments are missing or partially missing. The program will automatically use the default input file name "input.txt" and output file name "output.txt".
The command above will provide more defaults on the other executable options.

--Clean--

The makefile also includes a clean function which removes the executable, and object files.

--Existing Problems--

-Program works fine, although the times seems confusing because the parent is printing termination output when it checks the pid array in checkForTerminatedChildren.
-Not sure if global output file pointer will cause problem in the future.
